    <h2>Description<h2>
    This is the best brownie in the entire world <br>
    <ul>Ingredients
    <li>10 tablespoons (145 grams) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups (250 grams) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>80 grams of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1/4 rounded teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 large cold eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Directions
    <li>Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides.
    <li>Add enough water to a medium saucepan so that it is 1 to 2 inches deep. Heat water until barely simmering. Combine butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and the salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over simmering water
    <li>Stir mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and mixture is quite warm. Donâ€™t worry if it looks gritty, it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour. Remove the bowl from heat and set aside for 3 to 5 minutes until it is only warm, not hot.
    <li>Stir in vanilla with a wooden spoon or spatula. Then, add eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.
    <li>When the batter looks thick, shiny and well blended, add the flour and stir until fully incorporated, then beat with the wooden spoon or spatula for 40 to 50 strokes. (The batter will be quite thick). Beat vigorously here. You want to see the batter pulling away from the sides of the bowl (if you do not have the strength to do this by hand, use a hand mixer). Stir in nuts, if using. Spread evenly in lined pan.
    <li>Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick can be inserted into the center and come out almost clean
    <li>Cool completely then remove from pan. For the cleanest lines when cutting, place into freezer for 20 to 30 minutes to firm up. 
    </ol>
